# Return Cost Processing Implementation Summary

## Overview
Task 7 "Return Cost Processing" has been successfully implemented with comprehensive return cost validation, business rules, and profit impact calculation.

## Implemented Features

### 1. Return Cost Input Modal
- **Location**: `src/components/orders/order-actions.tsx`
- **Features**:
  - Modal appears when changing order status to "RETURNED"
  - Input field for return shipping cost with validation
  - Shows order total for reference
  - Warning message about consequences of processing return
  - Real-time validation with error messages

### 2. Return Cost Validation
- **Location**: `src/lib/orders.ts` and `src/lib/profit-calculation.ts`
- **Business Rules**:
  - Return cost cannot be negative
  - Return cost cannot exceed $10,000 (configurable limit)
  - Warning for return costs > $1,000
  - Validation that return cost is reasonable (not more than 10x order total)

### 3. Order Status Update API Enhancement
- **Location**: `src/app/api/orders/[orderId]/status/route.ts`
- **Features**:
  - Enhanced schema validation for return cost
  - Business rule validation before processing
  - Proper error handling and response messages

### 4. Profit Calculation Integration
- **Location**: `src/lib/profit-calculation.ts`
- **Features**:
  - Automatic profit recalculation when return is processed
  - Return cost included in total cost calculation
  - Proper handling of default return costs from tenant configuration
  - Validation methods for return cost business rules

### 5. Business Rules Implementation
- **Location**: `src/lib/orders.ts`
- **Rules**:
  - Valid status transitions to RETURNED: PENDING → RETURNED, CONFIRMED → RETURNED, SHIPPED → RETURNED, DELIVERED → RETURNED
  - Invalid transitions: CANCELLED → RETURNED, RETURNED → RETURNED
  - Automatic inventory restoration when processing returns
  - Stock adjustment records created for audit trail

### 6. Enhanced User Experience
- **Features**:
  - Clear modal with order context
  - Validation feedback in real-time
  - Warning about irreversible nature of returns
  - Inventory restoration notification
  - Profit impact calculation

## Testing
- **Location**: `src/lib/__tests__/return-cost-processing.test.ts`
- **Coverage**:
  - Return cost validation (negative values, excessive amounts)
  - Business rule validation (status transitions)
  - Profit calculation with return costs
  - Inventory restoration logic
  - Edge cases and error scenarios
