3. WHEN I select a start date and end date THEN the system SHALL filter orders to show only those created within the selected range (inclusive)
4. WHEN I apply a date range filter THEN the URL SHALL be updated with the date range parameters for bookmarking and sharing
5. WHEN I clear the date range filter THEN all orders SHALL be displayed according to other active filters

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a date range filter is active THEN the filter button SHALL display the selected date range
2. WHEN no date range is selected THEN the filter button SHALL display "All dates" or similar default text
3. WHEN a date range is active THEN I SHALL see a clear way to remove/reset the date filter
4. WHEN the date range results in no orders THEN I SHALL see an appropriate "No orders found for selected date range" message
